"""Reusable evals (LLM-as-judge) for Department quality gates.

One eval suite encodes a quality standard for one payload kind; a judge
supplies structured verdicts; the engine computes an EvalReport that machine
steps (e.g. the content-campaign quality_gate) require as evidence before a
campaign can advance.

Public surface:

- models: EvalCriterion, EvalSuite, EvalVerdict, EvalReport
- judge:  AgentJudgeConnector (honest default), HttpJudgeConnector (stub seam)
- engine: run_suite, render_request, validate_verdicts, compute_report
- registry: register_suite, discover_suites, suites, get_suite
- serialization: suite_spec, report_to_evidence
