"""Single derivation of the SpielOS project root.

Resolution order — deterministic first:

1. **Vendored anchor**: if this very file lives inside a real SpielOS home
   (its checkout root contains ``.spielos/`` or ``.agents/``), that root is
   returned unconditionally. This is the historical behavior: every process
   — Runner, plugin, or host — resolves to the same home no matter
   what its cwd is.
2. ``SPIELOS_HOME`` environment variable (explicit override for installed
   console-script usage).
3. Nearest ancestor of the current working directory that looks like a
   SpielOS home. Only used when the package is *installed* (site-packages)
   and therefore has no vendored home of its own.
4. Last resort: the current working directory (fresh ``spielos init`` runs
   before any state exists).
