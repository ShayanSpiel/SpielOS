# SpielOS

SpielOS is a local clean-core runtime for durable Goals.

[spielos.xyz](https://spielos.xyz) · `GoalRuntime` owns the persisted loop:
observe, decide, act, and evaluate. Departments are declarative packages;
Agents, Skills, Connections, Capabilities, and Hosts provide replaceable
execution declarations. Every material result is recorded as Evidence and can
inform owner, workflow, or strategy Memory.

## Talk to your Director

```sh
opencode    # or: codex, or: claude
```

In **OpenCode**: run `/agents`, select the **Director** agent, and talk to
it — it already sees your company state.

In **Codex**: talk to the **Director** agent — it already sees your company
state.

In **Claude Code**: run `claude --agent director` (or just `claude`) and talk
to it — Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, a one-line bridge to the same
`AGENTS.md` every host shares, and the context hook injects fresh company
state, so the Director already sees where things stand.

The host injects a fresh, read-only company projection into every model
request; do not begin with a manual status probe.

## Commands

```sh
spielos status            # one Goal or the company snapshot
spielos overview          # the full company projection
spielos observe           # read-only dashboard (health, goals, attention, repetition)
spielos observe --goal <id> # causal trace: Goal -> Runs -> Interventions
spielos context           # the same context your host injects
spielos memory summary    # owner, workflow, and strategy memory
spielos memory add --scope workflow --claim "..." --evidence <id> --goal <id> --run <id>
spielos memory retire <memory_id>   # flip one stale claim out of the active set
spielos profile list      # owner profile claims
spielos notifications list
spielos runner tick       # advance every ready Run once
spielos goal create --name "..." --owner director --metric ... --target ...
spielos goal list          # every Goal with its Run and stage
spielos goal decide <goal_id> --kind execute_workflow --workflow <department>:<workflow>
spielos goal decide <goal_id> --kind request_agent --agent <id> --instruction "..." --evidence-kind <kind>
spielos goal resume <goal_id>   # open the next run of a stalled or review-parked goal
spielos approve <goal_id> --note "..." [--key legal] [--scope run]
spielos tasks             # open work orders
spielos tasks <id> --complete <agent> --evidence '[...]' [--learning "claim"]
spielos layout            # audit the canonical layout for drift
spielos update --dir .    # refresh this home (global CLI, after pipx upgrade)
spielos export <department_id> --out <folder>   # write a shareable Department bundle repo
spielos import <folder>   # install a Department bundle from a local folder
```

Always run `update` through the global `spielos` command — it refreshes the
home from the installed release's templates. Running
`PYTHONPATH=.agents python3 -m company update` inside the home would try to
copy the home's own files onto themselves. `update` overwrites the vendored
`.agents/` spine and the host-adapter files the release itself ships
(Director prompts, Codex and Claude Code hooks, the notifications plugin) —
those always
refresh to the current release bytes, including in homes created before the
vendored manifest existed. Private `.spielos/` state,
`opencode.json`/`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` owner edits, the owner's
`.claude/settings.json` (permissions and keys are only ever appended the
SpielOS hooks, never rewritten; `.claude/settings.local.json` is never
written), and every owner-created file in the
user layers (Departments, Skills, Capabilities, Connections, Strategy,
installed Agents, host agents/commands/plugins) are always preserved. In a
home with a vendored manifest, stale files from older releases are pruned; a
pre-manifest home has no history to consult, so it keeps every file the
release does not ship and the manifest written by the update resolves that
on the next one.

## Department bundles (portability)

A Department is portable as a repository import, not an archive download.

- `company export <department_id> --out <folder>` runs in a home and
  writes a complete bundle-repository folder: `bundle.json` (identity,
  version, spine pin, closure file list), the department package, its
  full dependency closure (skills, capabilities, connections, installed
  agents, strategy documents), and a step-by-step `README.md` whose
  per-adopter paste-prompt blocks (OpenCode, Codex, Claude Code) tell
  the Director to import the bundle through the goal loop. An export
  whose closure is incomplete refuses, naming every missing piece.
- `company import <folder>` validates the manifest, the spine pin (an
  incompatible pin fails naming the repair and installs nothing), the
  closure (the bundle or the home must satisfy every reference), and
  the declaration against the live contracts, then installs ONLY into
  the six owner layers. It is idempotent: re-import refreshes
  bundle-owned paths to bundle bytes; owner files outside the bundle
  list are never touched; conflicting non-bundle content is never
  overwritten. The vendored spine, host trees, and settings are never
  writable by an import.
- `spielos update` preserves every imported file (they are owner-layer
  content) and the department still imports cleanly after the update.

The generated README is the onboarding surface: the adopter clones or
downloads the bundle repository, pastes the prompt for their host, and
the Director performs the import through one bounded goal.

## Executor identity (declared-agent claims)

WorkOrder execution is bound to the declared agent. A step's order belongs
to the agent its workflow step declares; a direct order belongs to the
agent the owner named. Only that exact identity — matched as an exact
string, with no aliases or normalization — can claim, renew, fail, or
complete the order, and an expired lease can be re-claimed only by the same
declared agent. The documented flow is claim-then-complete
(`tasks <id> --claim <agent>`, then `tasks <id> --complete <agent>`):
completing an open order is refused until it is claimed, and work for an
undeclared executor is refused upfront — a workflow step (or direct
assignment) whose agent is neither installed, nor the goal owner, nor
declared by the owning Department escalates to the owner with a message
naming the agent, and no WorkOrder is created for it. The goal owner
completes a direct order whose declared agent is the owner by
construction, not by override.

## The DECIDE boundary

`DECIDE` is the reasoning seam: a Run the runtime cannot decide for the
owner parks a structured decision request instead of inventing work.

- A Goal whose owner is not a Department (or whose Department declares no
  workflow) parks a decision request: the Run stays at DECIDE/waiting, one
  owner notification carries what is needed, why, the candidate Departments
  and workflows that declare the metric, and the installed Agents. No
  Intervention and no WorkOrder is created — no content-free "choose
  bounded work" order can exist. The owner-facing fields are owner prose
  (goal name, human progress, named options); the exact answer syntax rides
  the payload for the Director, which records the owner's plain-words
  answer through the CLI itself.
- The owner answers with `goal decide`: `--kind execute_workflow` adopts
  one of the candidate workflows, or `--kind request_agent` assigns bounded
  direct work whose instruction is mandatory (an empty instruction is
  refused).
- Stalls park: when a Goal's evaluated metric holds the same value across
  `stall_threshold` runs (default 3) and a run produced no new evidence,
  the next run is created parked with a continue/adjust/pause ask; a
  `review_every` config parks at that cadence. `goal resume` opens the next
  run; a DECIDE park is refused until it is decided.
- Progressing runs chain automatically. There are no per-run owner gates:
  EVALUATE opens the next Run on its own, and the loop parks only at
  approval or authority boundaries, a decision request, a stall or review
  threshold, or when a goal-level decision keeps escalating.

## Memory taxonomy, retrieval, and causal injection

Memory has one classification: owner preferences, constraints, and
authority live in owner scope (written with `profile set`, no evidence
needed); operational lessons live in workflow scope (written with
`tasks <id> --complete --learning`, conditional on something genuinely
reusable being learned); owner strategic direction stated during tasks
lives in strategy scope (written with `memory add --scope strategy`, or
distilled at an evaluation boundary when the evidence genuinely changes
a future Goal-level choice). Completing work without a lesson writes no
memory, and the deterministic catalog never fabricates strategy claims.

Memory retrieval is topology-aware: `relevant(goal_id=B)` returns B's own
strategy claims plus the active strategy claims of Goals B is
structurally related to — siblings (the same parent goal), its parent,
its children, and both directions of a `supports` edge — never the
claims of unrelated Goals. Direct-work lessons are goal-keyed: a
workflow-scope claim with no workflow_id (written by `tasks <id>
--complete --learning` on a direct order) reaches future direct orders
of that same Goal exactly. Owner and workflow scoping are otherwise
unchanged.

Memory is causal, not decorative: every WorkOrder brief carries a
bounded `memory` list — the workflow's own recorded learning for
workflow orders, the goal-relevant claims (never owner profile claims)
for direct ones, including the goal's own direct-work lessons
(workflow_id NULL, written by `tasks --complete --learning`), so the
executor's next execution builds on what the last one learned. Parked
asks render the same learning as
`Workflow learning: <claims>` / `Relevant memory: <claims>` lines; with
no claims recorded the brief key and the line stay empty.

A retired claim (`memory retire <id>`) keeps its row and evidence but
leaves the active set, so retrieval and briefs stop carrying it.

`spielos observe` also surfaces a repetition signal: three or more
completed direct work orders with the same instruction on one goal appear
as a bounded `repetition` entry suggesting the work may merit a reusable
Workflow proposed through adoption.

## Context projection

`spielos context` focuses the Goal the scheduler would run next: the
focus follows `runs.ready()` priority order (deadline/priority aware —
the same order the loop schedules in), falling back to the most recently
updated active Goal when nothing is ready. For the focus goal the
projection renders a `Recent decisions` line (each of the last 3 runs in
plain words) and a `Departments that can move this goal` line, each only
when it has content.

## Owner voice

Owner-facing text is human narration from start to finish: goals render by
name with human progress ("0 of 1"), evidence renders as
outcome sentences ("replies 2, sent 10000"), the loop position renders in
plain words ("next step: choosing the next move"), and parks ask in plain
words with named options. Raw ids, metric keys, stage/status enums,
payloads, and CLI answer syntax never enter owner-facing text: the
projection carries them in one compact `Machine reference` line at the
end, and parked asks carry them in their payload machine fields — the
Director quotes them only when the owner asks for technical detail. The
owner answers in plain words; the Director records the answer through the
CLI (`goal decide`, `goal resume`, `approve`).

## Owner-ask hygiene

`approve` answers the current intervention's pending ask — the
notification is acknowledged before the run resumes, so an approved ask
stops re-delivering while a new gate's own ask stays pending. Approving
`--scope step` without an active intervention is refused with the right
answer path: a DECIDE park is answered with `goal decide`, a stalled or
review-parked run with `goal resume`. Topology audits no longer flag a
healthy home with several independent root goals — the root ids are
reported, and only genuine defects (cycles, missing parents, missing
edge goals, abandoned blockers) count. Unknown comparison operators
raise instead of silently failing closed.

## Canonical layout

Company content lives in exactly these layers under `.agents/company/`:

| Layer | Contents |
|---|---|
| `departments/<id>/department.py` | one Department declaration per folder |
| `skills/<id>/SKILL.md` | one reusable Skill per folder |
| `capabilities/<id>/` | capability packages |
| `connections/` | connection registry and client modules |
| `strategy/` | canonical strategy documents |
| `agents/installed/` | installed worker Agents |

Never invent folders or files outside these layers; the Director is the host
agent prompt, not a Skill. Run `spielos layout` to audit drift.

## Vocabulary

| Concept | What it is |
|---|---|
| **GoalRuntime** | The one durable control loop |
| **Goal** | A measurable outcome with an owner, metric, and target |
| **Department** | A declarative, Agent-owned capability package |
| **Workflow** | Ordered steps with declared evidence and approval keys |
| **Agent** | Performs claimed work orders through a Host |
| **Evidence** | Immutable proof attached to Goals and Runs |
| **Memory** | owner / workflow / strategy scopes only |
| **Approval** | Explicit owner keys; external actions park first |

A new home starts with no bundled Departments. Add clean declarative packages
only when their Goal, Workflow, Agent, Evidence, and approval contracts are
ready.
