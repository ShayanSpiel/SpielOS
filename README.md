# SpielOS

**The operating system for AI-run companies.**

[spielos.xyz](https://spielos.xyz) · one durable Goal loop, Agent-owned
Departments, approvals, evidence, and memory — all local, all on disk.

```text
GOAL → OBSERVE → DECIDE → ACT → EVALUATE
```

Turn business intent into measurable Goals. The Director Agent (in OpenCode or
Codex) owns the conversation; SpielOS owns the durable loop behind it: every
run, work order, approval, evidence record, and memory item is persisted in a
local SQLite database — never lost when a chat session ends.

## Install

One line with [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io) (requires Python 3.11+):

```sh
pipx install spielos && spielos init --dir my-company -y
```

One line with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install shayanspiel/tap/spielos && spielos init --dir my-company -y
```

One line with npm (thin launcher; needs the Python package too):

```sh
npm i -g spielos && pipx install spielos && spielos init --dir my-company -y
```

One line with curl:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShayanSpiel/SpielOS/main/install.sh | sh
```

The chosen folder becomes a self-contained **SpielOS home**: the runtime
spine, Director agent + host adapters for OpenCode and Codex, and empty
private state. The `spielos` command itself is a global CLI — your company
data always lives in the folder you chose.

## Talk to your Director

```sh
cd my-company
opencode    # or: codex
```

In **OpenCode**: run `/agents`, select the **Director** agent, and talk to
it — it already sees your company state.

In **Codex**: talk to the **Director** agent — it already sees your company
state.

No manual probing, no `status` commands to start: the host injects a fresh,
read-only company projection into every model request.

## Update

```sh
pipx upgrade spielos && spielos update --dir /path/to/your/home
```

`update` refreshes only the vendored spine and host adapters; your private
`.spielos/` state, owner profile, memory, and user Departments are always
preserved. Stale files from older releases are pruned so the home matches a
fresh install exactly.

## What's inside

| Concept | What it is |
|---|---|
| **GoalRuntime** | The one durable control loop: observe, decide, act, evaluate |
| **Goal** | A measurable outcome with an owner, metric, and target |
| **Department** | A declarative, Agent-owned capability package |
| **Workflow** | Ordered steps with declared evidence and approval keys |
| **Agent** | Performs claimed work orders through a Host |
| **Evidence** | Immutable proof attached to Goals and Runs |
| **Memory** | Three scopes: owner profile, workflow learning, strategy learning |
| **Approval** | Explicit owner keys — external actions always park first |

Fresh homes start with **zero** Departments — add clean declarative packages
only when their Goal, Workflow, Agent, Evidence, and approval contracts are
ready.
